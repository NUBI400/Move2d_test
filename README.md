In this project I intended to make a 2D metroidvania game, but I ended up having to put this idea on hold because of other projects.

In the end, I only managed to make the game's movement with several movement states made to have an animation in each state with changes and so on.

Example of the animation: walking -> stopping -> stopped.

It was the first time I tried to do something like this and it was really fun.

Made in Godot
